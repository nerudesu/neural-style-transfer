Implementation of Style Transfer with Deep Neural Networks in PyTorch

Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.
